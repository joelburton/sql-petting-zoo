  This tutorial introduces JOIN which allows you to use data from two or more 
  tables. The tables contain all matches and goals from UEFA EURO 2012 Football 
  Championship in Poland and Ukraine.

questions:
  goals-scored-by-germany:
    title: Goals scored by Germany
    body: |
      The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. 
      The * says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying matchid, teamid, player, gtime

      Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. 
      To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'
    initial: |
      SELECT *
        FROM goal
        WHERE player LIKE '%Bender'
    solution: |
      SELECT matchid, player 
        FROM goal
        WHERE teamid = 'GER';
  
  info-for-match-1012:
    title: Information for match 1012
    body: |
      From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in match 1012. 
      Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.

      Notice in the that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id
      column in the match table. We can look up information about match 1012 by finding
      that row in the match table.

      Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just match 1012
    initial: |
      SELECT id, stadium, team1, team2
        FROM match
    solution: |
      SELECT id, stadium, team1, team2
        FROM match
        WHERE id = 1012;
  
  german-goals-via-join:
    title: Information on all German goals
    body: |
      You can combine the two steps into a single query with a JOIN.
      
        SELECT *
          FROM match
        JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
      
      The FROM clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the match table. 
      The ON says how to figure out which rows in match go with which rows in goal - the matchid 
      from goal must match id from match. (If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say
      ON (match.id=goal.matchid)

      The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the match table) for every goal scored.

      Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.
    initial: |
      SELECT player,stadium
        FROM match
        JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
    solution: |
      SELECT 
            goal.player,
            goal.teamid,
            match.stadium,
            match.mdate
        FROM match
        JOIN goal ON (match.id = goal.matchid)
        WHERE goal.teamid = 'GER';
  
  mario-goals-via-join:
    title: Information for all goals scored by a player named Mario
    body: |
      Use the same JOIN as in the previous question.

      Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player
      called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'
    initial: |


    solution: |
      SELECT match.team1, match.team2, goal.player
        FROM match
        JOIN goal ON (match.id = goal.matchid)
        WHERE goal.player LIKE 'Mario%';
  
  goals-in-first-ten:
    title: Information for all goals scored within the first ten minutes
    body: |
      The table eteam gives details of every national team including the coach. 
      You can JOIN goal to eteam using the phrase goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id

      Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10
    initial: |
      SELECT player, teamid, gtime
        FROM goal 
        WHERE gtime<=10
    solution: |
      SELECT 
            goal.player,
            goal.teamid,
            eteam.coach,
            goal.gtime
        FROM goal
        JOIN eteam ON (goal.teamid = eteam.id)
        WHERE goal.gtime<=10;
  
  all-matches-coached-by-fernando-santos:
    title: Information for all matches where Fernando Santos was the team1 coach.
    body: |
      To JOIN match with eteam you could use either
      match JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id) or match JOIN eteam ON (team2=eteam.id)

      Notice that because id is a column name in both match and eteam you must 
      specify eteam.id instead of just id

      List the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 
      'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.
    initial: |

    solution: |
      SELECT match.mdate, eteam.teamname
        FROM match
        JOIN eteam on match.team1 = eteam.id
        WHERE eteam.coach = 'Fernando Santos';
  
  players-for-all-goals-scored-in-warsaw:
    title: List the players for every goal scored in National Stadium, Warsaw
    body: |
      List the player for every goal scored in a match where the stadium was
      'National Stadium, Warsaw'
    initial: |

    solution: |
      SELECT goal.player
        FROM match
        JOIN goal on match.id = goal.matchid
        WHERE match.stadium = 'National Stadium, Warsaw';

  all-players-who-scored-against-germany:
    title: List the players who scored a goal against Germany
    body: |
      The example query shows all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal.
      Instead, show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.
    hint: 
      Select goals scored only by non-German players in matches where GER was the
      id of either team1 or team2.

      You can use teamid!='GER' to prevent listing German players.

      You can use DISTINCT to stop players being listed twice.
    initial: |
      SELECT player, gtime
        FROM match JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
        WHERE (team1='GER' AND team2='GRE');
    solution: |
      SELECT DISTINCT goal.player
        FROM match 
        JOIN goal ON goal.matchid = match.id
        WHERE goal.teamid != 'GER'
        AND (team1='GER' OR team2='GER');
  
  number-of-goals-scored-total-per-team:
    title: List the number of goals scored by each team, aggregated
    body: |
      Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.
    hint: 
      You should COUNT(*) in the SELECT line and GROUP BY teamname
    initial: |
      SELECT teamname, player
        FROM eteam JOIN goal ON id=teamid
        ORDER BY teamname
    solution: |
      SELECT eteam.teamname, COUNT(*) as goals
        FROM eteam 
        JOIN goal ON eteam.id = goal.teamid
        GROUP BY teamname
        ORDER BY teamname;
  
  number-of-goals-scored-total-per-stadium:
    title: List the number of goals scored in each stadium, aggregate
    body: |
      Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.
    initial: |

    solution: |
      SELECT stadium, COUNT(*) as goals
        FROM match JOIN goal ON match.id = goal.matchid
        GROUP BY stadium
        ORDER BY stadium;
  
  info-on-all-matches-involving-poland:
    title: List information, including goals scored, for all matches involving Poland
    body: |
      For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the 
      number of goals scored.
    initial: |
      SELECT matchid, mdate, team1, team2, teamid
        FROM match JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
        WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
    solution: |
      SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(*) as goals
        FROM match 
        JOIN goal ON goal.matchid = match.id 
        WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
        GROUP BY matchid, mdate;

  info-on-matches-and-goals-scored-by-germany:
    title: List information on matches and goals scored by Germany
    body: |
      For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date 
      and the number of goals scored by 'GER'
    initial: |

    solution: |
      SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(*) as num_germany_goals
        FROM match
        JOIN goal ON goal.matchid = match.id 
        WHERE goal.teamid = 'GER'
        GROUP BY matchid, mdate;
  
  all-matches-and-goals-per-team:
    title: List information on matches and goals scored by all teams
    body: |

      List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown.

      |
      | mdate        | team1  | score1 | team2   | score2   |
      | ------------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | -------- |
      | 1 July 2012  | ESP    | 4      | ITA     | 0        |
      | 10 June 2012 | ESP    | 1      | ITA     | 1        |
      | 10 June 2012 | IRL    | 1      | CRO     | 3        |


      Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal 
      then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2.

    initial: |
      SELECT 
        mdate,
        team1,
        CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END score1
        FROM match
        JOIN goal ON matchid = id

    solution: |
      SELECT 
        mdate,
        team1,
        SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as score1,
        team2,
        SUM(CASE WHEN teamid = team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as score2
        FROM match 
        LEFT JOIN goal ON goal.matchid = match.id
        GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2;
