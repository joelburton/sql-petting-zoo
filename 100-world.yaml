  ###### Per Capita GDP

   of the average salary. A rich country is one with a high per capita GDP.

  ###### Area
  The area is measured in square kilometers.

      SELECT name, gdp / population AS gdp_per_capita
        FROM world
        WHERE population >= 200000000

  south-america:
    title: South America In Millions
    body: |
      Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the
      region `'South America'`. Divide the population by 1000000 to get
      population in millions.
    initial: ""
    solution: |
      SELECT name, population / 1000000
        FROM world
        WHERE region = 'South America';

        WHERE name IN ('France', 'Germany', 'Italy');

      -- another possibility:
      -- WHERE name = 'France' OR name = 'Germany' OR name = 'Italy';

  united:
    title: United
    body: |
      Show the names of countries which have a name that includes the word
      'United'.
    solution: |
      SELECT name
        FROM world
        WHERE name LIKE '%United%';

  two-ways-to-be-big:
    title: Two ways to be big
    body: |
      Two ways to be big: A country is big if it has an area of more than 3
      million sq km or it has a population of more than 250 million.

      **Show the countries that are big by area or big by population.
      Show name, population and area.**
    solution: |
      SELECT name, population, area
        FROM world
        WHERE area > 3000000 OR population >= 250000000;

  xor:
    title: One or the other (but not both)
    body: |
      **Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area (more than
      3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both.
      Show name, population and area.**

      - Australia: big area but a small population: **included.**
      - Indonesia: big population but small area: **included.**
      - China: big population and big area: **excluded.**
      - United Kingdom: small population and small area: **excluded.**
    solution: |
      SELECT name, population, area
        FROM world
        WHERE (area > 3000000 OR population >= 250000000)
          AND NOT (area > 3000000 AND population >= 250000000)

  rounding:
    title: Rounding
    body: |
      Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for
      the countries of the region 'South America'. Use the `ROUND` function
      to show the values to two decimal places.

      **For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions
      both to 2 decimal places.**
    hint: |
      Divide by 1000000 (6 zeros) for millions. Divide by 1000000000
      (9 zeros) for billions.
    solution: |
      SELECT
          name,
          ROUND(population / 1000000, 2) as population_mn,
          ROUND(gdp / 1000000000, 2) AS gdp_bn
        FROM world
        WHERE region = 'South America';

  trillion-dollar-econs:
    title: Trillion dollar economies
    body: |
      Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of
      at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this
      value to the nearest 1000.

      **Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest
      $1000.**
    solution: |
      SELECT
          name,
          ROUND(gdp / population, -3) as per_capita_gdp
        FROM world
        WHERE gdp >= 1000000000000;

  name-cap-same-length:
    title: Name and capital have same length
    body: |
      The capital of Greece is Athens. Both of 'Greece' and 'Athens' have 6
      characters.

      **Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same
      number of characters.**
    hint: |
      You can use the `LENGTH` function to find the number of characters in
      a string.
    initial: |
      SELECT name, LEN(name),
             region, LEN(region),
             capital, LEN(capital)
        FROM world
       WHERE name LIKE 'G%'
    solution: |
      SELECT name, capital
        FROM world
        WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital)

  matching-name-and-cap:
    title: Matching name and capital
    body: |
      The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'.

      **Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match.
      Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same
      word.**
    hint: |
      - You can use the function `LEFT` to isolate the first character.
      - You can use `<>` as the "not equals" operator.
    initial: |
      SELECT name, LEFT(name, 1), capital
        FROM world;
    solution: |
      SELECT name, capital
        FROM world
        WHERE LEFT(name, 1) = LEFT(capital, 1)
          AND name <> capital;

  all-the-vowels:
    title: All the vowels
    body: |
      Equatorial Guinea and Dominican Republic have all of the vowels
      (a e i o u) in the name. They don't count because they have more than
      one word in the name.

      **Find the name of the country that has all the vowels and no spaces
      in its name.**

      - You can use the phrase name NOT LIKE '%a%' to exclude characters from
        your results.
      - The query shown misses countries like Bahamas and Belarus because
        they contain at least one 'a'
    initial: |
      SELECT name
        FROM world
        WHERE name LIKE 'B%'
          AND name NOT LIKE '%a%'
    solution: |
      SELECT name
      FROM world
      WHERE name ILIKE '%a%'
        AND name ILIKE '%e%'
        AND name ILIKE '%i%'
        AND name ILIKE '%o%'
        AND name ILIKE '%u%'
        AND NOT name ILIKE '% %';
