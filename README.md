# SQL Petting Zoo

A reimplementation of [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net), using a nicer UI, modern
tech stack, and a PostgreSQL backend. It also can show the solution, but
remembers if users have peeked at the solution. This allows it to be used for
self-study, but also for instructors to see what students could solve on their
own.

## Tech Stack

- Flask backend API for loading problem statements and talking to PostgreSQL
- React frontend
- Problem sets are in YAML
