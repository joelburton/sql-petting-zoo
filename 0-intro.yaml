    title: Introducing world table of countries
    body: |
      The example uses a WHERE clause to show the population of 'France'.
      Note that strings (pieces of text that are data) should be in
      `'single quotes'`.

      **Modify it to show the population of Germany.**
    initial: |
      SELECT population
        FROM world
        WHERE name = 'France';
    solution: |
      SELECT population
        FROM world
        WHERE name = 'Germany';

      Checking a list: The word `IN` allows us to check if an item is in a list.
      The example shows the name and population for the countries 'Brazil',
      'Russia', 'India' and 'China'.

      **Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.**
    initial: |
      SELECT name, population FROM world
        WHERE name IN ('Brazil', 'Russia', 'India', 'China');
    solution: |
      SELECT name, population FROM world
        WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');

    title: Just the right size
    body: |
      Which countries are not too small and not too big? `BETWEEN` allows range
      checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). The example
      below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km.

      **Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area
      between 200,000 and 250,000.**
    initial: |
      SELECT name, area FROM world
        WHERE area BETWEEN 250000 AND 300000;
    solution: |
      SELECT name, area FROM world
        WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000;
